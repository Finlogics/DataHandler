- always write minimal code that does the job. do not excessively put if statements or check edge cases. your docstring for methods and classes should not exceed 1 line. do not use chopping format to break method calls and definitions to multiple line. do not use module methods unless necessary. prefer to use classes and OO paradigm when appropriate.
